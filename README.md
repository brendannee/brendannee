### Hi, I'm Brendan 👋

I'm an entrepreneur, developer and transportation planner/engineer based in San Francisco, CA.

I'm a transportation geek: I own a 1980s MUNI bendy-bus and my high school and college jobs were at a bike store, on the deck of a passenger steamboat, and working the ramp at MSP for a regional airline.

In my professional life, I run [BlinkTag Inc](https://blinktag.com) which works at the intersection of technology, transportation and city planning.
